<!-- 1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

ans: No. HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, may contain some content and a closing tag.
    For example, <h1>Heading 1</h1> is a HTML element but just <h1> is a starting tag and </h1> is a closing tag. -->

<!-- 2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?

ans: Tags are the primary component of the HTML that defines how the content will be structured/ formatted, 
    whereas Attributes are used along with the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the element. 
    For example, <p align=” center”>Interview questions</p>, in this the ‘align’ is the attribute using which we will align the paragraph to show in the center of the view.

<!-- 3. What are void elements in HTML?
