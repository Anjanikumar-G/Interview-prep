<!-- 1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

ans: No. HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, may contain some content and a closing tag.
    For example, <h1>Heading 1</h1> is a HTML element but just <h1> is a starting tag and </h1> is a closing tag. -->

<!-- 2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?

ans: Tags are the primary component of the HTML that defines how the content will be structured/ formatted, 
    whereas Attributes are used along with the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the element. 
    For example, <p align=” center”>Interview questions</p>, in this the ‘align’ is the attribute using which we will align the paragraph to show in the center of the view.
     -->
<!-- 3. What are void elements in HTML?   

ans:HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. For Example <br />, <img />, <hr />, etc -->

<!-- 4.What is the advantage of collapsing white space?

ans: First, it can help reduce the size of HTML documents, making them load faster. 
     This is because white space, such as extra spaces or line breaks, takes up unnecessary bytes in the document -->

<!-- 5. What are HTML Entities?

ans: An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).
     HTML entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), 
     and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).      -->
